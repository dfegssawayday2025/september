## 🧠 Background

On the **3rd–4th September**, we hosted a **2-day Hackathon** open to everyone in **DfE**, welcoming all skill levels and encouraging collaboration across teams. The main aims of the hackathon was to provide a chance to upskill by working on a real life projects and get the chance to network!

Participants worked on **four innovative projects** (one project per team), each proposed by colleagues from across the department who were looking for creative solutions to real-world challenges.

## 💡 The Projects

### 🔧 Automated QA of SPC/SEN

This project aims to **streamline the manual cross-checking** of school census data used in the *Schools, Pupils, and their Characteristics (SPC)* and *Special Educational Needs (SEN)* publications. Automating the QA process will save time, reduce errors, and enable earlier data visualisation to spot trends.

### 🏫 Developing a Historical School Identifier Dimension

This project tackles the challenge of **tracking schools over time**, even when identifiers like URN or LAESTAB change due to closures or mergers. The goal is to create a **historical link between identifiers** to support better **longitudinal analysis**.

### 📉 Persistent Absence Explorer

Using the Week 29 dataset, this project makes it easier to **analyse and compare persistent absence rates** across regions and school types. The tool aims to uncover **meaningful patterns and insights** to support policy and intervention.

### 🤖 Using LLMs for Third-Line QA on Statistical Releases

This team explored whether **large language models (LLMs)** can help spot **patterns, anomalies, or inconsistencies** in statistical data that traditional QA might miss. This would add an **extra layer of assurance and insight**.
