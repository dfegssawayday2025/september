## Lunch ðŸ¥ª

As you all know, there are currently budgetary restrictions on all awaydays and events. We were determined to find a way to put on the GSS awayday again this year after such a successful day in 2024, but this means we have some restrictions on what we can do.

The government is currently not allowing any spend on catering for events like this, and so our hands are unfortunately tied. We didnâ€™t think this should affect the day we have planned as the agenda is going absolutely jam packed full of valuable and fun sessions!

### What does this mean for you?

- If you are not Sheffield based, you will be able to claim T&S in line with the [department's expenses policy](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/travel-and-expenses/SitePages/claim.aspx#how-much-you-can-claim-for-subsistence). 
- On any claims for lunch on the day, please **change your cost centre to 10397 and email all receipts to analytical.lnd@education.gov.uk** as well as attaching in workday. 
- If you are staying overnight, please claim your other meals normally.
- Unfortunately, if you are Sheffield based, the venue is not over 10 miles from your workplace (the minimum distance for claims [as outlined in the guidance](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/travel-and-expenses/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7F87AB14-DE7E-4F79-B669-199BA8672DEA%7D&file=travel-and-expenses-policy.docx&wdLOR=c508B9ED3-E364-4412-BC99-1E98E39D9A83&action=default&mobileredirect=true)) and so Sheffield-ers will not be able to claim for lunch.
- Iâ€™ve raised this with the department's financial teams and had it reiterated that this is the guidance we must follow. Please make plans accordingly.

There are a number of nearby options for purchasing lunch, including the cafe inside the venue:

- [Eat at The Wave](https://sheffield.ac.uk/cafesandbars/wave-kitchen)
- [Food on Campus](https://sheffield.ac.uk/cafesandbars/cafes)
