## Why Attend the GSS Away Day?

> The GSS Away Day is a fantastic opportunity for statisticians across the Department for Education to come together, share ideas, and learn from one another. This year’s theme: “Innovating and Learning Together” couldn’t be more timely. As we continue to navigate complex challenges and embrace new tools (and promote Datacamp for everyone!), it’s vital that we create space to reflect, collaborate, and grow.
>
> Whether you're presenting, attending a session, or simply connecting with colleagues, the day promises to be rich with insights and inspiration. I’m particularly looking forward to the hackathon presentations and the practical learning and development sessions. These are great chances to see innovation in action and pick up tips that can make a real difference in our work.
>
> I encourage everyone to take part, you’ll leave with new ideas, fresh perspectives, and a stronger sense of community within the GSS.
>
> Ian Knowles, Chief Analyst
