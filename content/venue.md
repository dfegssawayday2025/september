#### Public transport from the station

To use public transport from the station, we recommend the 51 bus route from Arundel Gate (Stop AG11). Alternative routes are available, but some (like the 10a) drop you an approximately 10 minute uphill walk from the venue, whereas the 51 drops you only 2 minutes away. Bus routes take from 23-30 minutes.
